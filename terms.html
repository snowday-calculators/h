                <h2>4. Predictions and Accuracy</h2>

                <h3>4.1 Nature of Predictions</h3>
                <p>Snow Day Calculator provides <strong>probability estimates</strong> based on weather conditions and historical data. These are predictions, not guarantees. Actual school closure decisions are made by school administrators who may consider factors beyond those analyzed by our calculator.</p>

                <h3>4.2 No Guarantee of Accuracy</h3>
                <p>While we strive for high accuracy (currently 94.7% across all predictions), we cannot and do not guarantee that our predictions will be correct in every case. Weather is inherently unpredictable, and school closure decisions involve human judgment that cannot be perfectly modeled.</p>

                <h3>4.3 Not Official Information</h3>
                <p>Snow Day Calculator is <strong>not affiliated with any school district, educational institution, or government agency</strong>. Our predictions are not official announcements. Always check with your school district for official closure information.</p>

                <h3>4.4 User Responsibility</h3>
                <p>You are solely responsible for decisions you make based on our predictions. Snow Day Calculator is a tool to help inform your planning, not a definitive source of truth. We encourage users to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check official school district communications for confirmed closures</li>
                    <li>Monitor weather forecasts from official sources like NOAA and the National Weather Service</li>
                    <li>Use our predictions as one factor among many in your planning</li>
                    <li>Exercise independent judgment appropriate to your circumstances</li>
                </ul>
