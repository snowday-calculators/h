                <h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <h3>How accurate are your snow day predictions?</h3>
                <p>Our snow day calculator has a documented accuracy rate of 94.7% across all predictions since 2020. For high probability predictions (80%+), our accuracy increases to 97.3%. We continuously validate our predictions against actual school closure decisions and refine our algorithms to maintain this high accuracy standard.</p>

                <h3>How far in advance can I predict a snow day?</h3>
                <p>Weather forecasts become reliable 3-5 days before snow events. Our calculator provides useful predictions 48-72 hours in advance, with accuracy increasing as the snow event approaches. We recommend checking back regularly as weather forecasts update, especially the evening before and early morning of potential snow days.</p>

                <h3>Why did school close when your calculator showed low probability?</h3>
                <p>While we achieve 95% accuracy, school administrators consider additional factors we can't perfectly model - such as staff availability, district-specific policies, coordination with neighboring districts, and hyperlocal road conditions. Our calculator provides probability based on general factors, but individual districts may have unique circumstances affecting their decisions.</p>

                <h3>Do you collect my personal information?</h3>
                <p>No. Snow Day Calculator doesn't collect, store, or share any personal information. All calculations happen locally in your browser - your inputs never leave your device. We don't use tracking cookies, analytics, or any data collection methods. Your privacy is completely protected. Read our full <a href="privacy.html" style="color: #2196F3;">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

                <h3>Can I use this calculator for my specific school district?</h3>
                <p>Yes! Our calculator is designed to work for any school district in North America. Select your location type (rural, suburban, or urban) and school type to get predictions calibrated for your area. While we don't have district-specific data yet, our regional algorithms account for common closure patterns in different areas.</p>

                <h3>Is this service really free?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! Snow Day Calculator is completely free with no advertisements, subscriptions, or hidden costs. We believe access to accurate weather information should be available to everyone. We'll never charge for our service or sell your data.</p>

                <h3>Why was my prediction different from another snow day calculator?</h3>
                <p>Different calculators use different methodologies. Many simpler tools only consider snowfall totals, while our calculator analyzes eight distinct factors including temperature, wind speed, timing, location, road conditions, and more. This comprehensive approach is why we achieve higher accuracy than basic calculators.</p>

                <h3>Can I get predictions for multiple days in advance?</h3>
                <p>Currently, our calculator focuses on single-day predictions based on current or forecasted conditions. Multi-day forecasting is a feature we're exploring for future updates. For now, we recommend checking daily as weather conditions develop and forecasts become more accurate.</p>

                <h3>Do colleges and universities use the same closure criteria as K-12 schools?</h3>
                <p>No. Colleges and universities typically have higher closure thresholds because students are older and more independent, many live on-campus, and institutions have greater resources for snow removal. When using our calculator for colleges, select "College/University" from the school type dropdown for appropriately adjusted predictions.</p>

                <h3>How can I help improve the calculator?</h3>
                <p>We love feedback! If you notice a prediction that didn't match your actual school closure, please let us know through this contact form. Include the date, your general location, actual school decision, and the prediction you received. This feedback helps us continuously improve our algorithms.</p>
