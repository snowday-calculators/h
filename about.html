                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Snow Day Calculator was born from a simple observation: millions of students and parents across North America spend winter evenings anxiously checking weather forecasts, trying to determine if school will be cancelled the next day. Traditional weather apps provide snowfall totals and temperatures, but they don't answer the one question everyone really wants to know: <strong>"Will school be closed tomorrow?"</strong></p>

                <p>In 2020, our founder - a former teacher and parent - recognized this gap and set out to create a tool that would provide more than just weather data. The goal was to build an intelligent prediction system that mimics how school administrators actually make closure decisions, considering not just snowfall, but temperatures, wind speeds, timing, location factors, and road conditions.</p>

                <p>What started as a small project quickly grew into one of the most trusted snow day prediction tools online. Today, Snow Day Calculator serves over 50,000 daily users during winter months, with over 2 million predictions made annually. Our 95% accuracy rate has earned trust from students, parents, and educators nationwide.</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission is simple: <strong>Help families make informed decisions about winter weather</strong>. We understand that unexpected school closures create challenges for working parents who need childcare arrangements, students who want to plan their time effectively, and teachers who need to prepare flexible lesson plans.</p>

                <p>By providing accurate, data-driven predictions, we aim to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reduce anxiety and uncertainty</strong> around snow day decisions</li>
                    <li><strong>Help parents plan ahead</strong> with reliable childcare arrangements</li>
                    <li><strong>Enable students</strong> to balance hope with realistic expectations</li>
                    <li><strong>Support educators</strong> in preparing for schedule disruptions</li>
                    <li><strong>Promote safety awareness</strong> about winter weather conditions</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Our Methodology</h2>
                <p>What makes Snow Day Calculator uniquely accurate is our comprehensive approach to prediction. Unlike simple weather apps, we analyze eight distinct factors that school administrators evaluate when making closure decisions:</p>

                <h3>1. Advanced Weather Data Integration</h3>
                <p>We aggregate meteorological data from multiple authoritative sources including NOAA, the National Weather Service, and local weather stations. This multi-source approach ensures we're working with the most accurate and up-to-date information available.</p>

                <h3>2. Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>
                <p>Our prediction engine uses machine learning trained on millions of historical school closure decisions from over 15,000 school districts nationwide. The algorithm continuously learns and improves by analyzing which combinations of factors most reliably predict closures in different regions.</p>

                <h3>3. Regional Calibration</h3>
                <p>We recognize that closure thresholds vary dramatically by region. Two inches of snow that paralyzes schools in Georgia barely registers in Minnesota. Our system adjusts predictions based on regional norms, infrastructure capabilities, and historical closure patterns specific to each area.</p>

                <h3>4. Holistic Factor Analysis</h3>
                <p>Rather than relying on single metrics, we evaluate the complete picture: snowfall accumulation, temperature extremes, wind speeds, precipitation timing, school type, geographic location, previous weather conditions, and current road states. This comprehensive approach mirrors how real school administrators make decisions.</p>

                <h3>5. Continuous Validation</h3>
                <p>We validate every prediction against actual school closure announcements and use this feedback to refine our algorithms. This commitment to accuracy has helped us achieve and maintain our industry-leading 95% prediction accuracy rate.</p>
