                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0; color: #1b5e20;"><strong>Snow Day Calculator does not collect, store, track, or share any personal information.</strong> Your privacy is completely protected. All calculations happen locally in your browser - your data never leaves your device.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>At Snow Day Calculator, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that we receive through our website and services (collectively, the "Service").</p>

                <p>Unlike many websites, we've deliberately designed our Service to operate with <strong>zero data collection</strong>. This policy explains what that means and how we protect your privacy.</p>

                <h2>2. Information We DO NOT Collect</h2>
                <p>Snow Day Calculator is built on a foundation of privacy. We do not collect:</p>

                <h3>2.1 Personal Information</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Names, addresses, or contact information</li>

                    <li>Account credentials (we don't have user accounts)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.2 Device and Usage Information</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>IP addresses</li>
                    <li>Browser types or versions</li>
                    <li>Device identifiers</li>
                    <li>Operating system information</li>
                    <li>Pages visited or time spent on site</li>
                    <li>Referring websites</li>
                    <li>Click patterns or navigation paths</li>
                    <li>Search queries or calculator inputs</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.3 Location Data</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>GPS coordinates</li>
                    <li>Precise geographic locations</li>
                    <li>City or regional data</li>
                    <li>School district information</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.4 Tracking Technologies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cookies (except essential session cookies if needed)</li>
                    <li>Web beacons or pixel tags</li>
                    <li>Analytics scripts</li>
                    <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
                    <li>Social media trackers</li>
                    <li>Third-party tracking mechanisms</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. How Our Calculator Works (Client-Side Processing)</h2>
                <p>When you use our snow day calculator, all calculations occur <strong>locally in your web browser</strong>. Here's what happens:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>You enter data:</strong> Weather conditions, school type, location type, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>JavaScript processes locally:</strong> Your browser runs our calculation algorithm using only the data you provided</li>
                    <li><strong>Results display instantly:</strong> Predictions appear on your screen without any server communication</li>
                    <li><strong>No data transmission:</strong> Your inputs never leave your device or get sent to our servers</li>
                    <li><strong>No storage:</strong> Once you close or refresh the page, your data is completely gone</li>
                </ol>

                <p>This client-side architecture ensures complete privacy. We couldn't access your calculator inputs even if we wanted to - they simply don't exist anywhere except temporarily in your browser's memory.</p>

                <h2>4. Information We MAY Collect (Contact Forms Only)</h2>
                <p>The only situation where we may collect information is if you voluntarily contact us through our contact form. In this case:</p>

                <h3>4.1 Voluntary Information</h3>
                <p>When you use our contact form, you may provide:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your name (optional)</li>
                    <li>Your email address (required for response)</li>
                    <li>Subject of your inquiry</li>
                    <li>Message content</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4.2 Use of Contact Information</h3>
                <p>Information provided through contact forms is used solely to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Respond to your inquiry or feedback</li>
                    <li>Address technical issues you report</li>
                    <li>Consider feature suggestions you submit</li>
                    <li>Improve our service based on your feedback</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4.3 Retention of Contact Information</h3>
                <p>We retain contact form submissions only as long as necessary to respond to your inquiry and maintain reasonable records. You may request deletion of your contact information at any time.</p>

                <h2>5. No Third-Party Sharing</h2>
                <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any information with third parties for any reason. This includes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advertisers:</strong> We don't use advertising networks or share data with advertisers</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytics Companies:</strong> We don't use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or similar services</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Brokers:</strong> We never sell data to third-party data brokers</li>
                    <li><strong>Marketing Companies:</strong> We don't share information for marketing purposes</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Media Platforms:</strong> We don't integrate with or share data to social platforms</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Partners:</strong> We have no business partners with whom we share data</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The only exception would be if required by law (such as a valid subpoena), but since we don't collect data in the first place, there would be nothing to share.</p>

                <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>

                <h3>6.1 Our Cookie Policy</h3>
                <p>Snow Day Calculator does not use cookies for tracking, analytics, or advertising purposes. The only cookies we might use are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Essential Session Cookies:</strong> Strictly necessary cookies required for basic site functionality (if any)</li>
                    <li><strong>No Tracking Cookies:</strong> We never use cookies to track your behavior across sessions or websites</li>
                    <li><strong>No Third-Party Cookies:</strong> Our site doesn't load third-party cookies from advertisers or analytics services</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6.2 Browser Storage</h3>
                <p>Our calculator may temporarily use browser storage (localStorage or sessionStorage) to enhance your experience, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remembering your last calculator inputs during your current session (optional)</li>
                    <li>Storing display preferences like dark mode (if implemented)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This storage is local to your device and never transmitted to our servers. You can clear it at any time through your browser settings.</p>

                <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Snow Day Calculator is safe for users of all ages, including children under 13. Because we don't collect any personal information, we automatically comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar regulations.</p>

                <p>Parents can confidently allow their children to use our calculator knowing that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No personal information is collected</li>
                    <li>No accounts or registrations are required</li>
                    <li>No tracking or profiling occurs</li>
                    <li>No advertisements are displayed</li>
                    <li>No third-party content that might collect data</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
                <p>While we don't collect data (making security concerns minimal), we still maintain security best practices:</p>

                <h3>8.1 Technical Security Measures</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTTPS Encryption:</strong> Our site uses HTTPS to encrypt communication between your browser and our servers</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Hosting:</strong> Hosted on GitHub Pages, a secure and reliable platform</li>
                    <li><strong>No Server-Side Database:</strong> We don't maintain databases that could be compromised</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular Updates:</strong> We keep our codebase updated to address any security vulnerabilities</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>8.2 Your Responsibility</h3>
                <p>While we provide a secure platform, your privacy also depends on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keeping your device and browser secure</li>
                    <li>Using up-to-date software and security patches</li>
                    <li>Being cautious about what information you share through contact forms</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>9. Your Privacy Rights</h2>

                <h3>9.1 General Rights</h3>
                <p>Because we don't collect personal data, many privacy rights are automatically satisfied:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> There's no data to access</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> There's no data to delete</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Portability:</strong> There's no data to export</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Correction:</strong> There's no data to correct</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> There's no processing to object to</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>9.2 Contact Form Data Rights</h3>
                <p>If you've contacted us through our form, you have the right to:</p>

                    <li>Withdraw consent for us to retain your information</li>
                </ul>

                <p>To exercise these rights, simply contact us through our <a href="contact.html" style="color: #2196F3;">contact form</a> with your request.</p>

                <h2>10. International Users and Data Transfers</h2>
                <p>Snow Day Calculator is accessible worldwide. However, since we don't collect personal data, international data transfer regulations (like GDPR) are largely not applicable. Our privacy-first approach automatically complies with most international privacy standards.</p>

                <h3>10.1 GDPR Compliance (European Users)</h3>
                <p>For users in the European Union:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We don't process personal data, so GDPR data processing obligations don't apply</li>
                    <li>No consent is required because no data is collected</li>
                    <li>We don't engage in profiling or automated decision-making</li>
                    <li>No data is transferred outside the EU (because no data exists)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>10.2 CCPA Compliance (California Users)</h3>
                <p>For users in California:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We don't sell personal information (we don't collect it in the first place)</li>
                    <li>We don't share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising</li>
                    <li>No opt-out mechanisms are needed because there's nothing to opt out of</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>11. Third-Party Links</h2>
                <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party websites (such as NOAA, National Weather Service, or educational resources). These third-party sites have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.</p>

                <p>We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party websites. Clicking external links means leaving our privacy-protected environment and entering another site's privacy jurisdiction.</p>

                <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. When we make changes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We'll update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy</li>
                    <li>Material changes will be prominently posted on our homepage</li>
                    <li>Your continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. However, our core commitment to not collecting personal data will not change without explicit notice and user consent mechanisms.</p>

                <h2>13. GitHub Pages Hosting</h2>
                <p>Our Service is hosted on GitHub Pages. While we don't collect data, GitHub may collect certain technical information for operational and security purposes. This is governed by <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2196F3;">GitHub's Privacy Statement</a>.</p>

                <p>GitHub may collect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Basic server logs for security and performance</li>
                    <li>Technical information required to serve web pages</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This collection is minimal and outside our control. We chose GitHub Pages specifically because of their strong privacy and security practices.</p>

                <h2>14. Do Not Track Signals</h2>
                <p>Some browsers offer "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals. Because we don't track users in the first place, DNT signals don't apply to our Service. You're already not being tracked, regardless of your browser settings.</p>

                <h2>15. Business Transfers</h2>
                <p>In the unlikely event that Snow Day Calculator is acquired by or merged with another entity, this privacy-first approach would be a core asset we'd insist on preserving. However, because we don't maintain user data, there would be no user data to transfer in such a scenario.</p>

                <h2>16. Law Enforcement and Legal Requests</h2>
                <p>We may disclose information if required by law, such as in response to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Valid subpoenas</li>
                    <li>Court orders</li>
                    <li>Legal processes</li>
                    <li>Government requests</li>
                </ul>

                <p>However, since we don't collect or store user data, we would have no information to provide in most cases. We cannot provide what we don't have.</p>

                <h2>17. Our Privacy Philosophy</h2>
                <p>Snow Day Calculator was built from the ground up with privacy as a core value, not an afterthought. We believe:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Privacy is a right:</strong> Users shouldn't have to trade privacy for utility</li>
                    <li><strong>Data minimization:</strong> The best way to protect data is not to collect it</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Users should know exactly what happens with their information</li>
                    <li><strong>User control:</strong> You should be in control of your information, always</li>
